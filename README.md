To compile the program, make sure the Makefile, tester.sh, lex.c, driver.c, compiler.h, and all 6 test files and all 6 output files are in the same folder.
Then all you have to do is type in "sudo bash tester.sh" into your terminal and the program will compile.
Insure that when you run the tester file that you are in the correct directory with all the files in it.
