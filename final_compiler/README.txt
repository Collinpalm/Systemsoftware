To run the compiler/vm combination :

1. add ALL the uploaded files into your working directory

2. Compile the all the uploaded c files using the makefile provided

3. Any test case input file must be named run with the compiled code on the command line "./a.out input.txt"

3. The program will output directly to the terminal so it is reccomended to pipe the output to a file

4. The flags -l to print the tokens; -s to print the symbol table; -a to print the codes; and -v to print the vm output

Everything will be printed to the terminal unless piped to a desired file.  This assignment was tested using Eustis3
(ubuntu20.04) and the gcc compiler.  It is EXTREMELY important that you use only the provided files, otherwise it might
not work.
