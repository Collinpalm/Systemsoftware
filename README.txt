To run the Virtual Machine :

1. Make sure that your working directory in your terminal (I used bash on Ubunutu)

2. Any test case input file must be named run with the compiled code on the command line "./a.out input.txt"

3. The program will output directly to the terminal so it is reccomended to pipe the output to a file

4. Use the command : " gcc -o vm vm.c"  to create a .out file called "vm"

5. Use the command : " ./vm"  to run the program

Everything will be printed to the terminal unless piped to a desired file.
